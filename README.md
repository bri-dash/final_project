# RTW Final Project: Playlist Picker

This project acts as a DJ for a group of users struggling to decide on a playlist.

## Installation

It uses socket.io and node.js in order to allow multi-user collaboration.

## Usage

Users access the homepage, take the survey, and submit their own answers when finished. When everyone has taken the quiz, one or all users press the finish button to generate a playlist based on their combined answers.
